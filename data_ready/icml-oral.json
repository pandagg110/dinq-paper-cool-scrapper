      "summary": "The Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) is currently experiencing rapid growth, driven by the advanced capabilities of language-based LLMs. Unlike their specialist predecessors, existing MLLMs are evolving towards a Multimodal Generalist paradigm. Initially limited to understanding multiple modalities, these models have advanced to not only comprehend but also generate across modalities. Their capabilities have expanded from coarse-grained to fine-grained multimodal understanding and from supporting singular modalities to accommodating a wide array of or even arbitrary modalities. To assess the capabilities of various MLLMs, a diverse array of benchmark test sets has been proposed. This leads to a critical question: *Can we simply assume that higher performance across tasks indicates a stronger MLLM capability, bringing us closer to human-level AI?*We argue that the answer is not as straightforward as it seems. In this project, we introduce an evaluation framework to delineate the capabilities and behaviors of current multimodal generalists. This framework, named **General-Level**, establishes 5-scale levels of MLLM performance and generality, offering a methodology to compare MLLMs and gauge the progress of existing systems towards more robust multimodal generalists and, ultimately, towards AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Central to our framework is the use of **Synergy** as the evaluative criterion, categorizing capabilities based on whether MLLMs preserve synergy across comprehension and generation, as well as across multimodal interactions.To evaluate the comprehensive abilities of various generalists, we present a massive multimodal benchmark, **General-Bench**, which encompasses a broader spectrum of skills, modalities, formats, and capabilities, including over 700 tasks and 325,800 instances. The evaluation results that involve over 100 existing state-of-the-art MLLMs uncover the capability rankings of generalists, highlighting the challenges in reaching genuine AI. We expect this project to pave the way for future research on next-generation multimodal foundation models, providing a robust infrastructure to accelerate the realization of AGI.Project Page: https://generalist.top/,Leaderboard: https://generalist.top/leaderboard/,Benchmark: https://huggingface.co/General-Level/.",

In this work, we show that the phenomenon of grokking is not specific to neural networks nor to gradient descent-based optimization. Specifically, we show that this phenomenon occurs when learning modular arithmetic with Recursive Feature Machines (RFM), an iterative algorithm that uses the Average Gradient Outer Product (AGOP) to enable task-specific feature learning with general machine learning models. When used in conjunction with kernel machines, iterating RFM results in a fast transition from random, near zero, test accuracy to perfect test accuracy. This transition cannot be predicted from the training loss, which is identically zero, nor from the test loss, which remains constant in initial iterations. Instead, as we show, the transition is completely determined by feature learning: RFM gradually learns block-circulant features to solve modular arithmetic. Paralleling the results for RFM, we show that neural networks that solve modular arithmetic also learn block-circulant features. Furthermore, we present theoretical evidence that RFM uses such block-circulant features to implement the Fourier Multiplication Algorithm, which prior work posited as the generalizing solution neural networks learn on these tasks. Our results demonstrate that emergence can result purely from learning task-relevant features and is not specific to neural architectures nor gradient descent-based optimization methods.

In response to these challenges, we introduce OmniBench, a self-generating, graph-based benchmark with an automated pipeline for synthesizing tasks of controllable complexity through subtask composition. To evaluate the diverse capabilities of virtual agents on the graph, we further present OmniEval, a multidimensional evaluation framework that includes subtask-level evaluation, graph-based metrics, and comprehensive tests across 10 capabilities. Our synthesized dataset contains 36k graph-structured tasks across 20 scenarios, achieving a 91% human acceptance rate. Training on our graph-structured data shows that it improves generalization across environments. We conduct multidimensional evaluations for virtual agents, revealing their performance across various capabilities and paving the way for future advancements.

OmniBench: A Scalable Multi-Dimensional Benchmark for Essential Virtual Agent Capabilities [PDF 19 ] [Copy] [Kimi 41 ] [REL] Authors : Wendong Bu , Yang Wu , Qifan Yu , Minghe Gao , Bingchen Miao , Zhenkui Zhang , Kaihang Pan , liyunfei , Mengze Li , Wei Ji , Juncheng Li , Siliang Tang , Yueting Zhuang As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, MLLM-based virtual agents have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, existing benchmarks face significant limitations, including uncontrollable task complexity, extensive manual annotation, and a lack of multidimensional evaluation. In response to these challenges, we introduce OmniBench, a self-generating, graph-based benchmark with an automated pipeline for synthesizing tasks of controllable complexity through subtask composition. To evaluate the diverse capabilities of virtual agents on the graph, we further present OmniEval, a multidimensional evaluation framework that includes subtask-level evaluation, graph-based metrics, and comprehensive tests across 10 capabilities. Our synthesized dataset contains 36k graph-structured tasks across 20 scenarios, achieving a 91% human acceptance rate. Training on our graph-structured data shows that it improves generalization across environments. We conduct multidimensional evaluations for virtual agents, revealing their performance across various capabilities and paving the way for future advancements.

This task is similar to committee elections, but unlike traditional settings, the candidate set comprises all possible statements of varying lengths, and so it can only be accessed through specific queries. Combining social choice and large language models, prior work has approached this challenge through a framework of generative social choice. We extend the framework in two fundamental ways, providing theoretical guarantees even in the face of approximately optimal queries and a budget limit on the overall length of the slate. Using GPT-4o to implement queries, we showcase our approach on datasets related to city improvement measures and drug reviews, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating representative slates from unstructured user opinions.",

      "raw_excerpt": "Generative Social Choice: The Next Generation [PDF 9 ] [Copy] [Kimi 24 ] [REL] Authors : Niclas Boehmer , Sara Fish , Ariel Procaccia A key task in certain democratic processes is to produce a concise slate of statements that proportionally represents the full spectrum of user opinions. This task is similar to committee elections, but unlike traditional settings, the candidate set comprises all possible statements of varying lengths, and so it can only be accessed through specific queries. Combining social choice and large language models, prior work has approached this challenge through a framework of generative social choice. We extend the framework in two fundamental ways, providing theoretical guarantees even in the face of approximately optimal queries and a budget limit on the overall length of the slate. Using GPT-4o to implement queries, we showcase our approach on datasets related to city improvement measures and drug reviews, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating representative slates from unstructured user opinions.

Experiments with RoBERTa and ModernBERT for text classification and single-vector retrieval, along with GPT-2 for language modeling, show that our method achieves substantial improvements in runtime and memory efficiency compared to existing α α -entmax implementations. It approaches---and in some cases surpasses---the efficiency of highly optimized softmax implementations like FlashAttention-2, enabling long-context training while maintaining strong task performance.

In this work, we explore the **learning dynamics** throughout the CPT process for large language models (LLMs). We specifically focus on how general and downstream domain performance evolves at each training step, with domain performance measured via validation losses. We have observed that the CPT loss curve fundamentally characterizes the transition from one curve to another hidden curve, and could be described by decoupling the effects of distribution shift and learning rate (LR) annealing. We derive a CPT scaling law that combines the two factors, enabling the prediction of loss at any (continual) training steps and across learning rate schedules (LRS) in CPT. Our formulation presents a comprehensive understanding of several critical factors in CPT, including the learning rate, the training steps, and the distribution distance between PT and CPT datasets.Moreover, our approach can be adapted to customize training hyper-parameters to different CPT goals such as balancing general and domain-specific performance.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scaling law holds across various CPT datasets and training hyper-parameters.",

We have observed that the CPT loss curve fundamentally characterizes the transition from one curve to another hidden curve, and could be described by decoupling the effects of distribution shift and learning rate (LR) annealing. We derive a CPT scaling law that combines the two factors, enabling the prediction of loss at any (continual) training steps and across learning rate schedules (LRS) in CPT. Our formulation presents a comprehensive understanding of several critical factors in CPT, including the learning rate, the training steps, and the distribution distance between PT and CPT datasets.Moreover, our approach can be adapted to customize training hyper-parameters to different CPT goals such as balancing general and domain-specific performance.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scaling law holds across various CPT datasets and training hyper-parameters.

To address this issue, we propose the Memory-driven Intrinsic Cost Estimation (MICE) method, which introduces intrinsic costs to mitigate underestimation and control bias to promote safer exploration. Inspired by flashbulb memory, where humans vividly recall dangerous experiences to avoid risks, MICE constructs a memory module that stores previously explored unsafe states to identify high-cost regions. The intrinsic cost is formulated as the pseudo-count of the current state visiting these risk regions. Furthermore, we propose an extrinsic-intrinsic cost value function that incorporates intrinsic costs and adopts a bias correction strategy. Using this function, we formulate an optimization objective within the trust region, along with corresponding optimization methods. Theoretically, we provide convergence guarantees for the proposed cost value function and establish the worst-case constraint violation for the MICE update.

This task requires the model to identify newly described objects that may be occluded or not directly visible in a novel view,posing a significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI.To support research in this area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, Ref-LERF.Our analysis reveals that 3D multi-modal understanding and spatial relationship modeling are key challenges for R3DGS.To address these challenges, we propose ReferSplat, a framework that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with natural language expressions in a spatially aware paradigm. ReferSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the newly proposed R3DGS task and 3D open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks.Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/heshuting555/ReferSplat.",

This task requires the model to identify newly described objects that may be occluded or not directly visible in a novel view,posing a significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI.To support research in this area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, Ref-LERF.Our analysis reveals that 3D multi-modal understanding and spatial relationship modeling are key challenges for R3DGS.To address these challenges, we propose ReferSplat, a framework that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with natural language expressions in a spatially aware paradigm. ReferSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the newly proposed R3DGS task and 3D open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks.Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/heshuting555/ReferSplat.

It has become an effective training paradigm due to the broader supervision information provided by the teacher distribution compared to one-hot labels. We identify that the core challenge in KD lies in balancing two mode-concentration effects: the \\textbf{\\textit{Hardness-Concentration}} effect, which refers to focusing on modes with large errors, and the \\textbf{\\textit{Confidence-Concentration}} effect, which refers to focusing on modes with high student confidence. Through an analysis of how probabilities are reassigned during gradient updates, we observe that these two effects are entangled in FKLD and RKLD, but in extreme forms. Specifically, both are too weak in FKLD, causing the student to fail to concentrate on the target class. In contrast, both are too strong in RKLD, causing the student to overly emphasize the target class while ignoring the broader distributional information from the teacher. To address this imbalance, we propose ABKD, a generic framework with α α - β β -divergence. Our theoretical results show that ABKD offers a smooth interpolation between FKLD and RKLD, achieving a better trade-off between these effects.

The most popular approach is to greedily search for the best feature at every decision point, which is fast but provably suboptimal. Recent approaches find the global optimum using branch and bound with dynamic programming, showing substantial improvements in accuracy and sparsity at great cost to scalability. An ideal solution would have the accuracy of an optimal method and the scalability of a greedy method. We introduce a family of algorithms called SPLIT (SParse Lookahead for Interpretable Trees) that moves us significantly forward in achieving this ideal balance. We demonstrate that not all sub-problems need to be solved to optimality to find high quality trees; greediness suffices near the leaves. Since each depth adds an exponential number of possible trees, this change makes our algorithms orders of magnitude faster than existing optimal methods, with negligible loss in performance. We extend this algorithm to allow scalable computation of sets of near-optimal trees (i.e., the Rashomon set).",

      "raw_excerpt": "Near-Optimal Decision Trees in a SPLIT Second [PDF 1 ] [Copy] [Kimi 3 ] [REL] Authors : Varun Babbar , Hayden McTavish , Cynthia Rudin , Margo Seltzer Decision tree optimization is fundamental to interpretable machine learning. The most popular approach is to greedily search for the best feature at every decision point, which is fast but provably suboptimal. Recent approaches find the global optimum using branch and bound with dynamic programming, showing substantial improvements in accuracy and sparsity at great cost to scalability. An ideal solution would have the accuracy of an optimal method and the scalability of a greedy method. We introduce a family of algorithms called SPLIT (SParse Lookahead for Interpretable Trees) that moves us significantly forward in achieving this ideal balance. We demonstrate that not all sub-problems need to be solved to optimality to find high quality trees; greediness suffices near the leaves. Since each depth adds an exponential number of possible trees, this change makes our algorithms orders of magnitude faster than existing optimal methods, with negligible loss in performance. We extend this algorithm to allow scalable computation of sets of near-optimal trees (i.e., the Rashomon set). Subject : ICML.2025 - Oral"

Unlike existing security benchmarks that often serve as proxies for real-world tasks, AutoAdvExBench directly measures LLMs' success on tasks regularly performed by machine learning security experts.

Unlike existing security benchmarks that often serve as proxies for real-world tasks, AutoAdvExBench directly measures LLMs' success on tasks regularly performed by machine learning security experts. This approach offers a significant advantage: if a LLM could solve the challenges presented in AutoAdvExBench, it would immediately present practical utility for adversarial machine learning researchers.

While critical windows have been studied at length in diffusion models, existing theory heavily relies on strong distributional assumptions and the particulars of Gaussian diffusion. In contrast to existing work our theory (1) applies to autoregressive and diffusion models; (2) makes very few distributional assumptions; (3) quantitatively improves previous bounds even when specialized to diffusions; and (4) requires basic mathematical tools.

While critical windows have been studied at length in diffusion models, existing theory heavily relies on strong distributional assumptions and the particulars of Gaussian diffusion. In contrast to existing work our theory (1) applies to autoregressive and diffusion models; (2) makes very few distributional assumptions; (3) quantitatively improves previous bounds even when specialized to diffusions; and (4) requires basic mathematical tools. Finally, we validate our predictions empirically for LLMs and find that critical windows often coincide with failures in problem solving for various math and reasoning benchmarks.

This allows us to cleanly and controllably quantify the creative limits of the present-day language model.Much like real-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our tasks require an implicit, open-ended _stochastic_ planning step that either (a) discovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay, drawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in designing math problems or new proteins).

We introduce a generalized smoothness property, based on the notion of abstract convexity, that is broader than Lipschitz smoothness and provide sufficient first- and second-order conditions. Notably, our framework encapsulates algorithms associated with the gradient clipping method and brings out novel insights for the class of ( L 0 , L 1 ) ( L 0 , L 1 ) -smooth functions that has received widespread interest recently, thus allowing us to extend beyond already established methods. We investigate the convergence of the proposed method in both the convex and nonconvex setting. Subject : ICML.2025 - Oral"

To support this argument, we examine how existing web authentication and authorization protocols, as well as natural language interfaces to common access control mechanisms, can be extended to enable secure authenticated delegation of authority to AI agents. By extending OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect with agent-specific credentials and using transparent translation of natural language permissions into robust scoping rules across diverse interaction modalities, we outline how authenticated delegation can be achieved to enable clear chains of accountability while maintaining compatibility with established authentication and web infrastructure for immediate compatibility.

There are prevalent claims in the machine learning literature that you need a bespoke causal framework or notation to answer causal questions. In this paper, we make it clear that you can answer any causal inference question within the realm of probabilistic modelling and inference, without causal-specific tools or notation. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate how causal questions can be tackled by writing down the probability of everything. We argue for the advantages of the generality of the probabilistic modelling lens, when compared to bespoke causal frameworks. Lastly, we reinterpret causal tools as emerging from standard probabilistic modelling and inference, elucidating their necessity and utility.",

These claims are usually backed by evaluation on competitive benchmarks—a tradition inherited from mainstream machine learning. But how do we separate real progress from a leaderboard flex? Medical LLM benchmarks, much like those in other fields, are arbitrarily constructed using medical licensing exam questions. For these benchmarks to truly measure progress, they must accurately capture the real-world tasks they aim to represent. In this position paper, we argue that medical LLM benchmarks should—and indeed can—be empirically evaluated for their construct validity. In the psychological testing literature, “construct validity” refers to the ability of a test to measure an underlying “construct”, that is the actual conceptual target of evaluation. By drawing an analogy between LLM benchmarks and psychological tests, we explain how frameworks from this field can provide empirical foundations for validating benchmarks. To put these ideas into practice, we use real-world clinical data in proof-of-concept experiments to evaluate popular medical LLM benchmarks and report significant gaps in their construct validity. Finally, we outline a vision for a new ecosystem of medical LLM evaluation centered around the creation of valid benchmarks.",

In this position paper, we argue that the debates on generative AI regulation can be informed by evidence on social media regulation. For example, AI companies have faced allegations of political bias which resemble the allegations social media companies have faced. First, we compare and contrast the affordances of generative AI and social media to highlight their similarities and differences. Then, we discuss four specific policy recommendations based on the evolution of social media and their regulation: (1) counter bias and perceptions thereof (e.g., via transparency, oversight boards, researcher access, democratic input), (2) address specific regulatory concerns (e.g., youth wellbeing, election integrity) and invest in trust and safety, (3) promote computational social science research, and (4) take on a more global perspective.
